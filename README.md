## Limitations

- **Functionality**: This form only demonstrates the structure and layout. It currently lacks form validation or backend integration.
- **Image Path**: Ensure that the `bank.png` image is available in the project directory or update the `src` attribute to a correct path.
- **Interactive Features**: The form does not include any JavaScript to handle form submission or interactivity at this point.
